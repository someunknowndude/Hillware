I still want to update this a bit, for example fix the ESP and make it more customizable, I might also potentially add autofarms for popular games like the glass bridge
After you installed Tampermonkey as well as the Joindata copier JavaScript get a game's join data, hop into the Roblox game and paste it in, you can run the script there already but I recommend to wait until you're fully loaded in
